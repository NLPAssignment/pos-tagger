##Part-of-Speech Tagging

`pos-tagger` is an assignment for the CS626 (Natural Language Processing) course at IIT-Bombay. It deals with the problem of Part-of-Speech tagging.

The corpus used is the BNC-tagged corpus consisting of over 8 million words. More information about the 61-tag BNC tagset can be found [here](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/docs/c5spec.html).

`pos-tagger` uses the HMM-based [Viterbi Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm) to tag a given sentence.
